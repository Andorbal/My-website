Long term data for freshwater mussel populations are rare, leaving substantial uncertainty
about many demographic processes in these taxa. A ten-year dataset has been developed
while monitoring a critically endangered species, the Texas hornshell (Popenaias popeii),
in southeastern New Mexico. Using mark-and-recapture, we estimated survival and
found it to be high (60-95%, annual apparent survival). Using program MARK, we
evaluated competing models of survival and found a negative correlation of survival with
water flow; 79% of mussels occupy habitat with velocities less than 0.05 m/sec that are
protected by travertine shelves, root mats, and boulders. Using length as a proxy for age,
we evaluated the age structure of the population. The length-frequency relationship was
similar across years, with a modal length near 100 mm. Use of length-frequency
distributions is predicated on a reliable relationship between age and length; therefore we
created age-length curves using both annual length data from the M/R study and annual
ring counts to explore this relationship. Using a VonBertalanffy growth curve, we
estimated an asymptotic length near 100 mm, which corresponded to estimates derived
from counted external annuli. Lengths substantially above estimated asymptotes indicate
the potential for extreme longevity and indeterminate growth. Overall, these estimates
and recent observations of small individuals (indicating recent recruitment) suggest that
this population is currently stable. However, due to the restriction in P. popeii’s range, it
remains vulnerable because there is little chance for recolonization in the event of an
environmental catastrophe such as an exceptionally high discharge event.
