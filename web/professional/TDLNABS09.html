<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Understanding
genetic structure and connectivity between populations of freshwater mussels is
essential to effective conservation. &nbsp;We examined two congeneric species
of freshwater mussels, <i style="">Quadrula pustulosa</i>
(QP) and <i style="">Q. quadrula</i> (QQ) throughout
their ranges, including the Upper Mississippi, Lower Mississippi, Hudson Bay,
Ohio, and Great Lakes watersheds. &nbsp;Use of congeners reduces taxonomic
distinctiveness, allowing comparisons of differences in life history. &nbsp;We
sequenced approximately 550 base pairs from the mitochondrial COI gene for 263
QP and 147 QQ individuals. &nbsp;While QP had more unique haplotypes than QQ
(0.44 unique haplotypes per individual versus 0.30), sequences from QP were
more closely related to one another than those of QQ (5.06 versus 9.74
nucleotide differences within population). &nbsp;An AMOVA attributed more
genetic structure to the population level in QP than QQ (&gt;90% compared to
47%). &nbsp;Both species had significant structure within populations, among
populations, and among regions. &nbsp;QP exhibited isolation-by-distance, while
QQ inter-population genetic distances did not increase with geographic
distance. &nbsp;Both species exhibited reduced diversity with increased
latitude, likely the result of recolonization after glaciation. &nbsp;Other
differences between these species may be attributable to host use, evolutionary
history and other life history traits. </span></p>
