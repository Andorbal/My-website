<p class="MsoNormal">The obligate reliance of freshwater mussels on aquatic vertebrates
as hosts of glochidia creates significant complications in understanding mussel
life history and demography, and in development of effective conservation
strategies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The typical approach for
identifying these hosts is via laboratory trials that identify potential host
species, but do not reveal which of these species are actually used by mussel
populations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laboratory trials
identified 23 of 30 species as potential hosts for <i style="">Popenaias popeii</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
conducted repeated surveys of fishes from the Black River, NM to determine
which species were infested with <i style="">P.
popeii</i> glochidia, and to measure the prevalence and intensity of
infestations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We calculated an
&#8220;ecological host index&#8221; that integrates fish abundance with infestation
prevalence and intensity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surveys
collected 2,115 individuals from 14 species of fish; of these, 249 individuals
of 14 species had encysted glochidia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three
species of catostomids had relatively low-to-moderate abundance, moderate-to-high
prevalence, and high intensity of infestations; one species of cyprinid had
moderate abundance, high prevalence and high intensity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other species had low abundance or
prevalence, and low intensity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Carpiodes carpio, Moxostoma congestum</i>,
and <i style="">Cyprinella lutrensis</i> had much
higher ecological host indices than any other species.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Infestations on benthic-dwelling catostomids
were on the face and operculum, while those on the water-column-dwelling <i style="">C. lutrensis</i> were on the gills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the list of ecologically
relevant host species is much smaller than the list of potential hosts
identified in laboratory trials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Successful conservation and restoration of unionid populations will
require the presence of this much smaller set of host species.</p>
